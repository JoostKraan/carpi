# CarPi

A custom, personal car infotainment system built for my car using a Raspberry Pi 5 and ESP32-WROVER.

---

## Overview

this app reads live data from my car, displays it on a touchscreen dashboard, and allows me to control various car features remotely through a companion [mobile app](https://github.com/JoostKraan/Car-Control-Application).

While the code and documentation are public for inspiration or reference, this system is highly customized for my specific hardware setup and vehicle.

## Features

### Current & Planned

- **Turn-by-turn navigation**
- **Central locking control**
- **Throttle input monitoring**
- **Status light display** (high/low beam, indicators, etc.)
- **Media player** (control phone audio and play through car radio)
- **Live sensor readouts:**
  - Outside & interior temperature
  - GPS location & speed (hall effect sensor)
- **RFID/NFC access**
- **Mobile app integration**
